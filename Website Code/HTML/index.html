      <p style = "text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction:column; align-items:center">
        New technology is being created every day to help the need for renewable energy. One of the most promising <br>
        renewable energy sources is solar power. Solar panels are used to harness the solar power in both homes and <br>
        businesses and  their use is growing rapidly.
        <br>
        <br>
        Throughout the years, solar panels provide renewable energy to homes, seeing a lot of wear on their ability to <br>
        produce energy. One of the main drawbacks to solar panel productivity is typically in the form of dirt or debris <br>
        that builds up over time and is baked into the panel because of the hot solar rays. This project aims to develop a <br>
        device that automates the process of cleaning solar panels.<br>
        <br>
        The goal of the device is to clear this build up from the solar panel. Currently this is done by cleaning the panel<br>
        using brushes and cleaning solution. The main benefit of the device will be to bring down the time spent manually <br>
        cleaning the solar panels and put that time towards other productive tasks. <br>
        <br>
        This automated cleaning device moves across the entire solar panel to be able to clean it and remove dirt and debris. <br>
        The mechanical side of the project creates the cleaver structure of the device to make it lightweight, efficient and be <br>
        able to balance on the solar panel. The electrical side of the project powers the device and gives it the ability to move <br>
        around the panel. The movement of the device will be controlled by multiple motors and sensors to track its movement<br>
        across the solar panels.<br>
        <br>
        The main benefactors of this device would be solar panel companies and solar panel owners. They will benefit by <br>
        having cleaner solar panels which will make the solar panels more efficient and produce more power. <br>

    <h3> Kristen Pepper </h3>
    <p style = "text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction:column; align-items:center">
      My name is Kristen Pepper and I am currently an electrical engineering student at Florida State University. <br>
      I started as a mechanical engineer at Florida State because I knew one day I wanted to work on cars, and I <br>
      thought that was the best path I could take. In my sophomore year of college, I switched my major to <br>
      electrical engineering because I was fascinated on how electricity could be used in many ways and lots <br>
      of ways are just starting to be discovered and worked on. One of these ways is the integration of electric <br>
      vehicles into todayâ€™s society. In spring of 2022, I will be graduating with my electrical engineering degree <br>
      and perusing my dream to work on electric vehicles at General Motors! I am thankful to the FAMU-FSU College <br>
      of Engineering for giving me and my classmates every possible opportunity to fulfill our dreams.
    </p>

    <h3> Justin Green </h3>
    <p style = "text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction:column; align-items:center">
      My name is Justin Green, as a former field radio operator in the United States Marine Corps, <br>
      I became passionate about military electronics and their advancement. After receiving an <br>
      honorable discharge in 2016, I came to Florida State to pursue an engineering degree. Today, <br>
      I am currently an electrical engineering student in my senior year at Florida State University <br>
      and graduate this spring. With that I am beyond grateful to have completed each of the courses <br>
      required for this degree. I would like to say to each and every professor that has invested time <br>
      in me over the years that I am thankful for each of you. After graduating, I will use the knowledge <br>
      I have learned to advance military electronics and begin to chase my dreams! <br>
      Thank you and GO NOLES!

    <h3> Edward Corlett </h3>
    <p style = "text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction:column; align-items:center">
      Hello, my name is Edward Corlett. I am a senior at Florida State University studying Electrical Engineering. <br>
      My goal as an engineer is to use my expertise to work with renewable energy and help to improve power <br>
      distribution infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h3> Tanner Buis </h3>
    <p style = "text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction:column; align-items:center">
      My name is Tanner Buis, I am a mechanical engineering student at Florida State University. I have a <br>
      passion for beach volleyball and my free time is entirely enveloped in becoming a better player. <br>
      After graduating I will be working for Duke Energy as a line engineer working with power lines that <br>
      travel across Florida. I hope to apply myself to power generation and transmission in order to make <br>
      the world a better place as this is the reason I started down the engineering track when I first <br>
      came to Florida State. I am passionate about this project because it heavily deals with power generation, <br>
      while the device we created doesnâ€™t generate power it makes it easier and more efficient for renewable <br>
      power generation to occur, driving us one step closer to making the world a better place.

    <h3> David Sailor </h3>
    <p style = "text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction:column; align-items:center">
      Iâ€™m David Sailor an electrical engineering student graduating from Florida A&M University and I chose <br>
      electrical engineering because I wanted to get an in depth understanding on how electrical systems work <br>
      and are implemented into modern society.  Moving forward after graduation I seek to enter the workforce <br>
      and apply key values; I have learned in university to be of service to society. Overall, I enjoyed my <br>
      experience and learned a substantial amount of information that can be used to be productive in the <br>
      workforce and other avenues in life. Iâ€™m stoked for whatâ€™s next!

    <h3> Caterina Arnold </h3>
    <p style = "text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction:column; align-items:center">
      My name is Caterina Arnold. My sister and I were raised on a large dairy farm in the panhandle by my <br>
      father, a Florida native, and mother, a newly naturalized Italian-American. We truly lived in the middle <br>
      of nowhere, and were left with not much else to do than explore. Not only were we surrounded by a vast <br>
      wilderness, but it was sustainably and actively managed by the machinery to match a farm of such magnitude. <br>
      I grew to respect the balance of life and was eager not only to understand, but to eventually play a role. <br>
      Gifted with an ever growing curiosity and festering infatuation with our ever-advancing society, I eventually <br>
      found myself at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering. Throughout my studies in Mechanical Engineering I not <br>
      only acquired answers to my many questions, but also the knowledge to make my own deductions from <br>
      the unknown. I aim to focus my efforts guiding humanity â€˜back to our roots,â€™ so to speak, by finding ways <br>
      to work with nature, rather than perpetually fight against it.
